# Task 1 : Text - Classifier

This repository contains the notebooks and auxiliar functions to  build a document classifier.

- Data exploration notebook contains data exploration and dataset splitting
- Training read the splitted data and build a classifier using a simple LinearSVC classifier using TfidfVectorizer features


## Task 2: Identify conflicting text

1. While finding contradictions, we may not know what to compare with what. How
can we use topic modeling to identify pairs of conflicting text in Consigli
documents?



2. What kinds of NLP techniques can be used for recognizing pairs of conflicting text
and the measure their inconsistencies?


3. Please suggest an outline of ML process where input is raw documents.
Discussion of pre-processing and feature extraction is welcomed, and tentative
model(s) should be proposed in the answer.
